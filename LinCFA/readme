LINCFA.py:

Class which takes as input a dataframe (or path) and the column name of the target (contained in the dataframe)
The method print_header shows some rows
The method compute_corr computes the pearson correlation between two columns
The method prepare_data standardizes the variables
The method compute_empirical_bound computes the threshold of correlation considering two variables: the mean of the already selected ones and the candidate to be aggregated (and it standardizes them). It returns the threshold and their correlation
The method find_neighbors considers the already selected variables to aggregate and returns their neighbours among the ones given by cols [neighbours = points closer than 0.1 on the x and y ax]
The method find_aggregation performs a cycle on the neighbours found to identify one neigbour that should be aggregated
The method COMPUTE_CLUSTERS prints and returns the list of aggregations with LinCFA
NOTE: the method does not need train/validation/test, the training set should be its input
